KMSAuto++ - KMS activator for operating systems
Windows VL editions: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012,
2012 R2, 2016, 2019, as well as Office 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019. Activation of Office 2010 VL
on Windows XP is possible.
The switches provide access to installing GVLK keys and configuring the task scheduler.

Additional program launch options (keys):
—————————————————————————————————

/win=act - Launch the program in hidden mode, activate Windows
and exit the program.
/ofs=act - Launch the program in hidden mode, activate Office
and exit the program.
/wingvlk=inst - Launch the program in hidden mode, install the Windows key
and exit the program.
/ofsgvlk=inst - Launch the program in hidden mode, install the Office keys
and exit the program.
/sched=win - Create a task in the scheduler to activate Windows every 25 days.
/sched=ofs - Create a task in the scheduler to activate Office every 25 days.

*** The keys are installed forcibly, the parameters can be applied all together.
*** Only non-activated office products can be converted RETAIL -> VL.

You can specify the external address of the KMS-Service on the "Settings" tab. The service built into the
program will not start upon activation. If activation error 0xc004f074, make sure that your firewall does not prohibit connections to your KMS-Service.
If you create a task for reactivation in the scheduler (there is a special tab for this in the program), you can move the program itself wherever you want, you can even completely
delete it, it is not needed for reactivation.

Installing KMS-Service
——————————————————————————————————

On the "Settings" tab, you can install KMS-Service in the system, Windows 7-8
will be able to activate from it independently, with the appropriate settings, at the address 127.0.0.2:port, and any systems and offices can be activated at your network address.
The installed server does not conflict with the task in the scheduler, nor with manual activation,
using the "Activate Windows" and "Activate Office" buttons. If your system is 8.1, a special driver will be installed for the duration of
activation, which will be removed upon completion of activation.
To do this, "== Integrated KMS-Service ==" must be set in the settings.
You can also configure activation from an external server, when activating using the buttons in
the Main program window, your system settings will not be changed, they will be restored immediately
after activation.
Using the two buttons at the bottom of the "Settings" window, you can view the log file of the running server.

"But nothing activates for me!!!!"
———————————————————————————————————————

Your product may not be VL, it is not intended for activation by KMS-Service
(Windows 7 Ultimate program DOES NOT ACTIVATE), or your antivirus is blocking activation.
